Matlab codes for computing are collected in "codes":
1. FCGR-SD.m is the main code, please modify it before using;
2. Both chaos.m and kmer_fcgr.m are needed for FCGR-SD.m to run successfully.

Five csv tables with data accession numbers are collected in "data":
1. TableS1: 30 influenza virus HA gene nucleotide sequences (NCBI);
2. TableS2: 44 SARS-CoV-2 genome nucleotide sequences (GISAID);
3. TableS3: 3283 SARS-CoV-2 genome nucleotide sequences (NCBI);
4. TableS4: 10348 SARS-CoV-2 genome/spike gene nucleotide sequences (GISAID);
5. TableS5: 2610 SARS-CoV-2 spike gene nucleotide sequences (GISAID).
